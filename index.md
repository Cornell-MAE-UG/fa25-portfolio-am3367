## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University studying Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Business Management. I am passionate about the intersection of business and engineering where technologies can be translated into tangible impact. I have pursued this interest through experiences in product management, product development, venture capital, and research. My dream is to work in a role that can take innvoations past the lab space and deliver them to consumers in a way that the impact is maximized.
